# Reflections

I had to do a lot of reverse engineering from the files with the code along. 

There are aspects of Angular that are easier, like it seems less cumbersome to implement things that equate to querySelectors and eventListeners. 

Still, I feel confident in doing absolutely none of it from scratch. I also feel daunted by just how large an Angular project package is. I recognize most of that I won't interact with, but it's still an intimidating amount of files. 

I'm perpetually struck by how much has to be absolutely perfect to run code successfully.  


# MyFirst(Arguably Third)App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
